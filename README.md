# Embedded Simulation with Cadmium v2

In this tutorial we are going to see:
1. How to **work** with the **Cadmium v2 simulator** to build an application to run **embedded**.
2. How to **debug** this application through simulations on PC.

We will address this by means of two examples: Blinky and Blinky-Improved.

## About the tutorial

This tutorial is presented as a _Jupyter Notebook_ to be able to introduce some tools, execute the simulation and analyze the results inside the same framework. 

However, it is not necessary to run Jupyter to follow the presentation since the notebooks are rendered directly on `GitHub`. Due to this fact, you just need to open the file `cadmiumv2_logging_howto.ipynb` in your web browser.
